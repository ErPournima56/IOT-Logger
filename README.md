# IOT-Logger
IoT Logger is a data capture and logging system designed to collect real-time information from external devices or machines and store it reliably in a MySQL database. It acts as a bridge between IoT devices (or industrial machines) and structured data storage, enabling long-term analysis, reporting, and integration with other systems.
